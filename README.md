# SvelteKit + TailwindCSS + daisyui components + Iconify icons

A template to quickly get you started building a visually appealing web app with SvelteKit.

Includes:
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
- [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) icons

This template uses TypeScript to add some type safety to your code as well.

NOTE: replace `npm` in the commands below with `pnpm`, `yarn` or whatever package manager you prefer. I happen to use `pnpm` myself.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
